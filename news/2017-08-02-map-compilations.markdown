If you want to download some DDNet maps you can now use the [DDNet Map Compilations](https://maps.ddnet.tw/compilations/) for each server. A full [git repository](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps) has been available for some time. You can also download individual maps from the same source where DDNet Client gets them, the [map server](https://maps.ddnet.tw/).
