Do you remember clan NUT? They presented maps with an unique design, often for bigger groups (up to 10(!) tees required).
<p>
We will release their normal, hardcore and short maps every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 2016-02-01 to 2016-03-25.
<p>
They are made mostly by Zeta-Hoernchen. Look for them on <a href="/ranks/ddmax/">DDmaX Server</a>.
