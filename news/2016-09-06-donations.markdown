Thanks to the people donating and sponsoring DDNet's servers we are able to keep DDNet running. [heinrich5991](/players/heinrich5991/) has just sponsored the DDNet.tw server for 2016, [MidnightCake](/players/MidnightCake/) has sponsored the DDNet USA server for 2016. [o\_tee\_one](/players/o_tee_one/) (CAN), [Tom](/players/Tom/) (CHN), [RafaelFF](/players/RafaelFF/) (Brazil) and [lordtheuns](/players/lordtheuns/) (South Africa) are continuously providing servers for DDNet!

This means we only have three servers left that are unsponsored this year: GER, RUS and Chile. If you want to help DDNet out, [we accept donations](/funding/) to cover the remaining costs for these servers (339 € as of today) and the remaining costs of the last years (652 €). On our [funding page](/funding/) you can also see a list of everyone who ever donated.
