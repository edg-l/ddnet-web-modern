Have you ever had Internet problems and still wanted to play your favorite DDNet maps? Now it has become a bit easier:

The [ddnet-maps](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps) repository contains all official DDNet maps, updated daily, ready to be run in your own server! Simply download this repository, add your DDNet-Server binary (distributed together with the [DDNet client](/downloads/)) and start the server. You can change the settings in autoexec_server.cfg

To download this repository you have two choices:

1. [Download the ZIP](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/archive/master.zip) and you get a current snapshot of all maps, but can't easily update it.
2. `git clone https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps` and you have the full history of this git repository. To update your copy of maps simply execute `git pull`.

To follow our map releases you can also check out [Recent Map Releases](/releases/) or subscribe to [the feed](/releases/feed/).
