As you might have noticed the [DDNet.tw](/) website had a Halloween theme for a bit of a longer time this year. Some people, including me, took a liking to the dark theme by [Soreu](https://ddnet.tw/players/Soreu/).

Now thanks to [Elouan](https://ddnet.tw/players/-9834-/) we have a theme switcher in the top right corner on [DDNet.tw](/) that allows you to enable the dark theme and keep the setting stored in a cookie in your browser.
