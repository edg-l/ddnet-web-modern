It's DDNet's 5th birthday and I'm happy to announce the [Teleport Gun Event](https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=6581) showing a new gameplay feature by Ryozuki and timakro. Thanks go to necropotame, forsaken and hi\_leute\_gll for helping!

From Friday, July 27 to Sunday, August 5 we will have a [Moderate map by Meliodafu & hi\_leute\_gll](/tournaments/teleportgun1/) and a [Solo map by hi\_leute\_gll](/tournaments/teleportgun2/) running, presenting the new feature. The best times when the event finishes will be shown in the [tournaments](/tournaments/) page.

See the [forum thread](https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=6581) for further information.
