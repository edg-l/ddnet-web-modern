After a suggestion by <a href="https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=3697">sorgaxD</a> I now implemented country specific ranks pages. This means you can now compare your ranks against everyone else playing on your own country server!

- [Global Ranks](/ranks/)
- [GER Ranks](/ranks/ger/)
- [RUS Ranks](/ranks/rus/)
- [Chile Ranks](/ranks/chl/)
- [Brazil Ranks](/ranks/bra/)
- [South Africa Ranks](/ranks/zaf/)
- [USA Ranks](/ranks/usa/)
- [CAN Ranks](/ranks/can/)
- [CHN Ranks](/ranks/chn/)
- [OLD Ranks](/ranks/old/) (Everything before 26. August 2014)

Note that the country ranks only start on 27. August 2014, all older ranks are in [OLD Ranks](/ranks/old/) because we didn't record the country of race finishes back then.
